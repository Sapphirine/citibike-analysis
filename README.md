# CitiBike--Analysis

### Proposal

1. Visualization showing the favorite neighbourhoods (start and end) of citibike users.
  - Estimating the requirement of bike stations in neighborhoods
  - Most common rides each month (by station and by neighbourhoods)
  - Estimating deficiency or surplus of bikes in neighbourhoods based on usage statistics (available bikes and used bike).

2. Creating a Regression Model to correlate weather impact on citibike activity and forecast future usage.

3. Analysis to compute avg. travel time from one station to another based on.
